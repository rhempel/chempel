Getting Started
---------------

We assume that development is happening inside a Docker Desktop Container
and that we are using VSCode's devcontainier capability to build and connect
to the container that will run our Jekyll instance,


, and that we ar



Getting Started - Deprecated
---------------

Since discovering the Docker ecosystem it ends up being stupidly easy
to make a container to build a Jekyll site.

Note that there are still times when what you really want is a VM (for example you
want to communicate with real hardware on external USB/Serial/parallel! ports)

To pull a minimal jekyll image:

sudo docker pull jekyll/minimal

To run the image interactively, change to the directory where this README is
located and:

sudo docker run -it \
  --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll:Z" \
  --publish [::1]:4000:4000 \
  jekyll/minimal \
  jekyll serve

sudo docker run --it \
  --rm \
  --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll:Z" \
  --publish [::1]:4000:4000 \
  jekyll/minimal \
  jekyll serve


You may need to update the gems from within the image interactively:

bundle update

Note: when this works well enough, eliminate the --it option or save the
container to run again later.

Image Management
----------------

In this case we are talking about picture files, which are generally
JPG or PNG files. PNG files are great for line drawings but they do
not compress as well as JPGs, and we want to serve up smaller but
high quality files.

We use GraphicsMagick to manage transforming files in bulk, but before we do that
let's have a look at how we manage the file structure for images:
