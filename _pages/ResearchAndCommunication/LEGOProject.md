Eco-city Exhibition, Vejle Bibliotek (Library) - Vejle, Denmark
===============================================================

By engaging with this playful exhibition, children and their
families are introduced to fundamental concepts of ecological
design and to think beyond the gray grid. They are encouraged
to imagine living in cities that are integrated with the
natural world.

Christine created this exhibition by designing and
building the LEGO model and supplemental materials.
She has developed workshops and activity books for builders
of all ages.

*Client: City of Vejle \\
Supported by Ole Kirk's Foundation and in collaboration
with the LEGO Community Engagement team*

Design With Nature / Design With LEGO
=====================================

![](/assets/images/Thumbnails/Research/LEGOProject/Detail3.png){: .align-left}

Throughout history, human societies that have been built on sustainable
relationships with nature have succeeded, while those that worked
against natural systems have collapsed. Human societies have altered
ecological systems profoundly, and the consequences are disastrous including
species extinction, global warming, and depletion of resources.

![](/assets/images/Thumbnails/Research/LEGOProject/Detail1.png){: .align-right}

City makers are now challenged to better understand and adapt to rapidly
changing environmental systems. We must envision cities and landscapes
that function with rather than against nature. The Eco-city model - in
combination with the Design With Nature exhibition and workshops, offers
an opportunity for children and adult visitors to learn some of the key
concepts of ecological planning in an engaging, creative way.

The exhibition and workshop guide is designed so that museum staff, teachers,
community volunteers, and students (age 13+) can guide visitors around the
model. They introduce key concepts of ecological design, and deliver workshops.
The exhibition introduces the contributions of three pioneers in the field of
ecological planning: Ian McHarg, Anne Spirn and Randolph Hester.

A series of short lessons and activities provided in the workshop guide
present a variety of ways to use scenarios in the model to demonstrate
essential themes to child, adult and professional audiences.
