Christine has designed and delivered verbal presentations for academic
conferences, city council meetings, university students, school-aged children,
and the general public. Most recently, she designed the exhibit “Design with
Nature: Design with LEGO” to communicate concepts of ecological design during
interactive play workshops with school-aged children.
