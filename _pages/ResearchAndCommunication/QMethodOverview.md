Q-method is an interactive research technique that measures a person’s
subjective view on a topic and looks for shared viewpoints among a group of
respondents. It can efficiently capture the essence of how participants feel
about a subject as collective voices, and at the same time find the subtle
differences between people’s views and values.

Although social scientists have been using Q-method for decades, is not yet
well-known and is still considered an emerging or innovative technique. Robust
quantitative data and rich qualitative information can be obtained from a
relatively small sample size.

Unlike open-ended interview techniques or surveys, participants express their
views by sorting a set of cards in order of preference on a pyramid-shaped
chart. Usually there are 40-60 cards, each with a statement on a topic, but
images can also be used. Analysis of the data provides results as sets of
factors that represent different perspectives shared by participants. Although
many researchers avoid statistical processes, freely available Q-method
software ensures that the analysis of data is quick to learn.

Simon Watts and Paul Stenner have published an excellent and readable guide
called [Doing Q-Methodological Research](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/doing-q-methodological-research/book234368)

Most Q-method projects follow a standardized step-by-step process:

1. Generation of the Q-Set

   * Statements are collected from a variety of sources (newspapers, literature,
     transcripts from interviews) that express subjective views about a topic

   * A representative set of statement cards is generated (usually 40-60)

1. Data Collection

   * Participants are selected because their opinions are sought on a given
     topic. A relatively small number of participants (~30) can provide robust
     results.

   * A Q-sorting sheet is generated with a forced-choice preference pyramid
     that allows participants to rank the statements according to level
     of agreement with statement relative to the other statements.\

1. Analysis and Interpretation of Data

    * Q-method software finds commonalities between the sorts, and generates
      factor arrays, which are ‘idealized’ or archetypical sorts

    * The idealized sorts are interpreted to better understand the viewpoint.
      Questionnaires may accompany the sorts to provide additional information
      that supports the interpretation process.

The main difference between this method and a conventional survey is that the
statement rankings are relative to each other, rather than individually. You get
a more nuanced view of your population by dividing them into 3 or 4 main areas
of agreement - which is useful when you are trying to get a holistic view of how
people see the problem you are trying to solve.

Christine has used Q-method in several projects: a statement-based study
examining perspectives on energy and sustainability, two Visual Q-method
projects that explored different aspects of environmental perception and
preference, and a Visual Q-method study exploring children’s preferences for
outdoor play activities.
