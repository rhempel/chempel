Workshops and community meetings are excellent events for creative problem
solving, social learning, and building relationships. But designing and
delivering workshops takes planning. Christine has designed, facilitated or
contributed to a variety of planning meetings, design charrettes and workshops,
using skills as designer, researcher, teacher and illustrator.

Christine designed a one-day workshop aimed at bringing together citizens,
elected officials and planners to find common ground on siting wind energy
planning in Grey and Bruce Counties in Ontario. This issue is highly contested,
but the workshop demonstrated ways that people with differing points of view
can come together and find consensus in a regional planning context.

As part of the Design with Nature, Design with LEGO exhibition at the Vejle
Okolariet, Christine created workshops using LEGO to teach school aged children
(and their parents) about sustainable city and landscape design. This work is
ongoing – look for more workshops in the fall of 2020!

As part of her Master’s research, Christine collaborated with students from
University of Waterloo’s School of Architecture and stakeholders from the City
of Galt to envision a revitalized urban core. The process began with a creative
and playful facilitated workshop event to share histories, goals and
opportunities for the city's downtown.

A facilitated workshop can be very informal - as part of a community-led design
project to build an edible forest garden and cycling pavilion in Vejle,
Denmark, Christine held brief, on-site design “workshops” with architecture
students from Aarhus School of Architecture.

Christine collaborated with LEGO Community Engagement team to design a mosaic
using LEGO in a sustainability workshop for children. The mosaic-building
project was led by high school students from the Tekerd! non-profit
organization.

As a graphic recorder, Christine can help synthesize key ideas from meetings,
presentations or conversations into images and text, increasing engagement and
enabling co-creation among participants.
