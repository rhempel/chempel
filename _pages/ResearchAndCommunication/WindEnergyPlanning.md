As part of her doctoral research, Christine developed new planning
methods for wind energy landscapes supported by meaningful community
involvement. The study began with an investigation of residents’
subjective views on future energy development, their visual landscape
preferences, and their perceptions of wind energy landscapes in
Grey, Bruce and Huron Counties, and culminated in a participatory,
community-based planning workshop.

The four-step Deliberative Mapping Process has the following steps:

1. Initiating conversation: sharing the results of individual mapping with table members
2. Deliberating siting issues in a shared conversation, seated in a circle around large maps
3. Collaborative mapping
4. Sharing results in a plenary session

Wind energy planning issues are highly complex, as citizens have deeply
rooted and often conflicting belief systems about energy development, and
divergent views about what changes are harmonious with the character of
existing physical and cultural landscapes. Effective siting of energy projects
requires knowledge of landscape character, including the biophysical aspects
of landscape, cultural values, and aesthetic experiences associated with ‘place’.

The landscape plans are developed using constraint mapping techniques, and are
informed by [Q-method values research](/Research/QMethodOverview/) conducted
prior to planning workshops. Twenty-seven participants (planners, elected
officials, wind developers, researchers and lay citizens) collaborated on
identifying most and least-preferred zones for future wind energy development.

This study concludes that how we adapt to changing landscapes differs because
of deeply rooted but differing place identities, but that common ground can be
reached in a planning context while accommodating diverse cultural relationships
to landscape.

The results point to new directions in planning policy that support
community-based rather than top-down provincial directives to plan for
significant changes to landscape, including rural infrastructure.
