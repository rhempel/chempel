Christine was commissioned to design façade transformation, interior scheme,
and front garden design to renovate the Grey Granite Club in downtown Owen
Sound, Ontario. Beginning with quick sketches, assessing the feasibility of an
adaptive re-use project can take less than ½ day. _Client: Northridge Properties_ 

Rough concept sketches are used early in the design process to meet the
clients and to quickly align on design direction.

A detailed planting plan is part of any adaptive re-use design that ensures
the space meets human needs for connections to green environments.
