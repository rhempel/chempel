Christine was hired by the Danish municipality of Vejle to
design and illustrate a garden demonstrating “edible forest”
concepts, located along a recreation trail system and the
centrepiece of a new planned development for 5000 residents.

Using a slow-charrette approach, Christine synthesized design
ideas from multiple stakeholders, including community
volunteers, architecture students and town planners.

The garden concepts include integration of zero-energy heated
bicycle pavilion (designed and built with recycled materials
by architecture students from Aarhus University), and plant
selection as suggested by the Skovhave volunteer group.
