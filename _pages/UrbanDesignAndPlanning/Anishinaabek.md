Christine helped create site planning concepts and community
visioning work for a recreational camping park in Springwater
Township.

{% include gallery id ="gallery_one" layout="half" %}

The park, to be jointly managed with Ontario Parks and Beausoleil
First Nation, includes an education centre, rough camping areas,
RV sites, and a trail system that connect to the regional
heritage First Nations trail network.

This scheme was presented as part of economic development plan
for the Beausoleil First Nations.

*Client: MacLeod Farley and Associates and Beausoleil First Nations*
