Christine developed a master plan and preliminary architectural concepts for a
new mixed-use research and innovation park at the Swedish University of
Agricultural Sciences campus. The site is currently an abandoned veterinary
hospital with asbestos contamination. The proposed projects will be constructed
after demolition of existing structures but maintains some of the existing
landscape form and most mature trees.
