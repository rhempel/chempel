# Introduction

Q-method is an interactive research technique that measures a person’s
subjective view on a topic and looks for shared viewpoints among a group of
respondents. Although social scientists have been using Q-method for decades,
is not yet well-known and considered an emerging or innovative technique.
Robust quantitative data can be obtained from a relatively small sample size,
and rich qualitative information can be enhanced with brief questionnaires.

Unlike open-ended interview techniques or surveys, participants express their
views by sorting a set of cards in order of preference on a pyramid-shaped
chart. Usually there are 40-60 cards, each with a statement on a topic, but
images can also be used. Software is used to analyze the results, providing
results as sets of factors that represent different perspectives shared by
participants. Although many researchers prefer qualitative techniques and avoid
statistical analysis, the process is easy to learn.

I have used Q-method in several projects: a statement-based study examining
perspectives on energy and sustainability, and three Visual Q-method projects
that explored different aspects of environmental perception and preference,
including a study with children. For details and/or results, contact me for
publications and research reports.

# Understanding Children’s Preferences for Outdoor Play Experiences

Understanding children’s preferences for outdoor play experiences In this
project, conducted for Aarhus University/LEGO Foundation©, visual images
depicting outdoor play activities were ranked in order of preference by
children between the ages of 6 and 12, living in Denmark. Results of this pilot
project showed 4 distinct preference types:

+ The Nurturing Child
+ The Active Child
+ The Creative Child
+ The Forest Child

# Exploring Perceptions of Landscape Character

These projects were conducted as part of a larger doctoral study funded by
Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. Visual Q-method was
used to explore citizens’ landscape preference in rural Ontario. Participants
sorted 35 watercolour paintings in order of preference. Results showed 4
distinct viewpoints about preferred landscapes.

# Preferences for Wind Energy Landscapes

A secondary study following the landscape preference research explored how
people view future scenarios of wind energy infrastructure. Paintings from the
landscape character study were adjusted digitally to show various siting
alternatives. Results found three key viewpoints among participants.
