# Introduction

Wind energy planning issues are highly complex, as citizens have deeply rooted
and often conflicting belief systems about energy development, and divergent
views about what changes are harmonious with the character of existing physical
and cultural landscapes. Effective siting of energy projects requires knowledge
of landscape character, including the biophysical aspects of landscape,
cultural values, and aesthetic experiences associated with ‘place’.

# Typical Workshop Agenda

Using constraint mapping techniques, and informed by values research conducted
prior to planning workshops, twenty-seven participants (planners, elected
officials, wind developers, researchers and lay citizens) collaborated on
identifying most and least-preferred zones for future wind energy development.
This study concludes that how we adapt to changing landscapes differs because
of deeply rooted but differing place identities, but that common ground can be
reached in a planning context while accommodating diverse cultural
relationships to landscape.

# Outcomes
 
The results point to new directions in planning policy that support
community-based rather than top-down provincial directives to plan for
significant changes to landscape, including rural infrastructure.
