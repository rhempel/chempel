Christine is able to synthesize key ideas from meetings, presentations,
and conversations into images and text. The result is increased engagement
and enables co-creation among participants. 

Graphic recording uses a combination of listening, drawing and design
skills, graphic to capture contributions, connections and voices in
real time.

Christine uses graphic recording to translate insights into a
collective vision of an event.

captures a collective vision and helped a neighbourhood group
take their idea from abstract initiative to reality.
